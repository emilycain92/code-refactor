Title- Horizeon's Landing Page

In This Project, I cloned original code and refactored the original content to be more accesible to users.

broken links were fixed and the appearance more closely resembles the "mock up" image.
I cleaned up some redundancy in css and added alt labels to images.

By adding comments to sections, any future changes will be a lot easier to navigate.
